Second project for MSCH-C 220

Welcome!

This is the second project for MSCH-C 220. I have adapted the simplified version of the game engine wrote in class.

I have also edited the game.json file provided.

Both files can be found at https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-F19/03-Text-adventure

This game is inspired by the lyrics of Hotel California by The Eagles.

I edited the first person perspective to sound closer to second person voicing, embellishing the lyrics to fit more into a short interactive narrative

Thanks for playing!

P.S. You can only terminate the program manually :P
